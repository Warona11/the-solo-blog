As though he is clearly upset about the betrayal Dj Maphorisa took matters to social media to address the issue.The drama between DJ Maphorisa and Samthing Soweto is rooted in creative differences, public comments, and misunderstandings that have sometimes played out in the media and on social platforms. Here’s a summary of the key elements of their conflict:

           1. Origins of Tension*  
              DJ Maphorisa and Samthing Soweto were both part of the massive success of the *Amapiano* genre, particularly with hits like "Amantombazane" and "Akulaleki." The drama seems to have started with disagreements over musical direction and creative contributions. Maphorisa is known for being a prominent producer and has had a hand in shaping the Amapiano sound, while Samthing Soweto is recognized for his unique vocal style. Their artistic differences led to a split.
           
           2. Public Comments:  
              DJ Maphorisa made several public statements implying that he was the key figure behind the success of Amapiano, which some interpreted as dismissive of other contributors, including Samthing Soweto. Samthing, on the other hand, has remained more low-key but has addressed some of these issues indirectly, often emphasizing the importance of collaboration and respect for other artists.
           
           Samthing Soweto's Departure from Amapiano:  
              At one point, Samthing Soweto seemed to step back from Amapiano music, leading to speculation that it might be related to tensions with DJ Maphorisa. While Samthing did not directly say that his departure was due to Maphorisa, the timing and lack of collaboration between the two sparked further rumors of a feud.
           
           Fans Fuel the Drama  
              Fans of both artists have often fueled the fire, pitting the two against each other on social media, comparing their contributions, and amplifying the narrative of a rift. This public attention has sometimes worsened the situation, as both artists have had to respond to speculation and rumors.
           
           Apology and Reconciliation Attempts 
              In some instances, there have been rumors that the two tried to reconcile, with both parties indicating a willingness to move past the drama. However, concrete collaborations between the two have not been frequent since the initial fallout.
           
           The tension between DJ Maphorisa and Samthing Soweto reflects broader issues of creative control and public recognition in the South African music scene, especially when dealing with a genre like Amapiano that has skyrocketed in popularity. However, both artists have continued to enjoy successful careers in their own right.
